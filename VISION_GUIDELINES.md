# PRion Vision Guidelines

This document defines the project vision alignment criteria for pull request triage.

## Vision Checks

- **Strategic fit**: The PR aligns with repository priorities and roadmap.
- **Community value**: The contribution improves quality, reliability, or maintainability.
- **Security posture**: The PR does not introduce unsafe dependencies or suspicious code patterns.
- **Operational impact**: The PR avoids unnecessary complexity and large risky changes.

## Founder Review Signals

Use this guide when reviewing PRs flagged by PRion as high-risk or low-trust.

- High trust + low risk + high strategic fit -> prioritize for review/merge.
- Low trust + high risk + low strategic fit -> request deeper human review.
- Potential duplicates -> consolidate with canonical PR while preserving authorship.

## Policy

PRion does not automatically delete, close, or merge pull requests.
All high-impact actions remain human-approved.
